Tourism in Apulia: Driving Open Data towards an Apulian Tourism Ontology
===========================================================================

This repository contains the result of a case study in which a set of Apulia open data about tourism are transformed in five stars open data and they are linked to other datasets in the LOD. The output of the transformation process is an OWL ontology containing 40 classes and about 36,300 instances linked to some datasets in the LOD, such as: DBpedia, Geonames, Km4city [3], Proton
and FOAF.

The transformation process requires three preliminary steps:
1. the selection of exiting datasets already published as open data;
2. the assessment of selected datasets;
3. the ontology designing.
